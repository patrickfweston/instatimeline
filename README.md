InstaTimeline

DESCRIPTION

InstaTimeline is a system built on top of TimelineJS in order to automatically generate a beautifully crafted timeline for specific events like weddings, concerts, sporting events, and etc.
Currently, InstaTimeline is in beta version so we are focusing on real time wedding events and painting a story.

EXAMPLE (BETA TESTING):
Given a unique hashtag for a wedding, InstaTimeline fetches posts from Instagram, orders these posts chronologically and selects only the meaningful posts to display. The final result is a beautiful timeline capturing the essence of the wedding celebration, from the proposal through the last dance at the reception.
